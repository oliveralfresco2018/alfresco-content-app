### Testing library

Run the application and ensure you have an extra navigation sidebar entry:

```sh
npm start
```

Click the `My Extension` link and in the main content area you will see the extension component coming from your library.

<p class="warning">
Depending on the application setup, you may need enabling external plugins via the `Settings` dialog available for `admin` users (clicking the application profile button).
